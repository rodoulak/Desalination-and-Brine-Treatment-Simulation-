# Tutorial for Economic model 

## 1. Introduction 
Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on running economic models. The economic model (`economic_f.py`) can be used to perform economic assessments of the treatment chain or of individual units to identify economic hotspots. The economic assessment will help researchers, engineers, and decision-makers improve the system's performance and select the most economically feasible integration of technologies. 

In this tutorial, we provide step-by-step instructions on how to [use economic models](#running-economic-model) and [analyse the results](#results-evaluation) obtained using **Example 1** as case study (see **Figure 1**).
