# Desalination and Brine Treatment Simulation Suite

 
## Overview 
This project comprises a suite of simulation models for desalination and brine treatment technologies, including reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, multi-effect distillation, chemical precipitation, eutectic freeze crystallization, electrodialysis, and thermal crystallization. These technologies are utilized for desalination, ion separation, and salt recovery processes in various industrial and environmental applications.

The simulation models implemented here calculate various parameters such as salt concentration profiles, ion fluxes, energy consumption, chemical consumption, and operational costs. They provide insights into the performance and economics of the technologies under different operating conditions and input parameters. Additionally, the models allow for the integration of different technologies in various configurations to optimize process efficiency and resource utilization.
